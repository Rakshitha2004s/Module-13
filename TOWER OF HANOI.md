# Exp.No:35 TOWER OF HANOI
# AIM
To write a Python program to implement Tower of Hanoi and display all the moves of the disks using a recursive function. Consider the names of the tower pegs as A, B, C. Get the number of disks value from the user.

# ALGORITHM
Start the program. Input the number of disks n. Print the number of disks. Define a recursive function TowerOfHanoi(n, source, destination, auxiliary): If n == 1: Print: "Move disk from source to destination". Else: Call TowerOfHanoi(n - 1, source, auxiliary, destination) → Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination as helper. Print: "Move disk from source to destination" → Move the largest disk to the destination. Call TowerOfHanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, destination, source) → Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source as helper. Call TowerOfHanoi(n, 'A', 'C', 'B') to start the process. End the program.

def TowerOfHanoi(n, source, destination, auxiliary):
    if (n > 0):
        TowerOfHanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, destination)   # Step 1: move n-1 disks
        print("Move disk from", source, "to", destination)  # Step 2: move the nth disk
        TowerOfHanoi(n-1, auxiliary, destination, source)   # Step 3: move n-1 disks

n = int(input())
print("No. of disks =", n)
